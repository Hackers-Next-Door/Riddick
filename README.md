# Riddick

This tool let you add random characters and/or personalize usernames or passwords
in common dictionaries, and thus make more ***target-focused*** attacks.

For instance, a person may not have a password like this:

```
Juan123
```

Maybe that person has a password like this:

```
Juan1999
```

## Drawbacks

- The resulting output will be **ENORMOUS**.
